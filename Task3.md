### Solve:
Here we go, Task 3. We're finally getting to some actual rev. 

First off, let's download the `server` executable and the `shredded.jpg` image. Opening up the image first, we are met with this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91396a8d-7f82-4a49-a136-312f737a121d)

Seems to be something written on shredded paper, which was crudely put back together. It looks like it reads `JASPER_0`, or it could be `JASPER_O`. We'll keep note of it for now, and move on to the `server` executable. 

Trying to run it gives us some interesting information. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36f4ab79-433a-451d-954e-e403260869e8)

We learn two key things from this. First, the `server` executable seems to be using something called `rpc`, which we can deduce from the `rpc error` message. Second, the executable needs to be able to ping some kind of auth service in order to work. 

After doing some research, we find that `rpc` is a protocol used to call remote functions. So the `server` executable is probably trying to call some kind of ping function from an auth server. Let's pop `server` into Ghidra and Binja and see what we find. I like to use both, since in some cases, Ghidra makes it easier to see some things than Binja, and vice versa. 

After Ghidra does its analysis, we find that `server` is a Go binary. Trying to find the main function, we find a whole lot of interesting functions, but among them, two `Ping` functions

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/161b0988-4d21-4eea-8b6c-39133466fa04)

However, there isn't really anything interesting there to build off of within them, but we'll keep our eye on these `main` functions. 

After some more snooping around, I stumble upon a jackpot of interesting functions each beginning with `auth`. Since the `server` executable is trying to ping what it calls an *auth* server, we're probably in the right place. Specifically here for these functions under `authServiceClient`, these seem to outline the RPC methods that the executable is able to call on the auth server, which are `Authenticate`, `Logout`, `Ping` (the one we're looking for), `RefreshToken`, `RegisterOTPSeed`, and `VerifyOTP`. So 6 in total. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91b35027-1d2e-4318-9f49-9fa36ced77d4)

Also under these `auth` functions, we can find functions that correspond to the requests and responses for the 6 functions we found above. So for `Ping`, we have `PingRequest` and `PingResponse` functions. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34702a39-7b8e-4da5-808e-6b1e152fb103)

We see some sub-functions that shed light on what parameters or fields each method is expecting for requests and responses. For example, for the `AuthRequest` function, there are sub-functions called `GetPassword` and `GetUsername`, which means that it probably expects a password and username as fields in the request. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5d4da74-1977-4e9b-aff9-8bab1b202d9b)

However, the most important thing for us is the `PingRequest` function, and if we take a look, it has a `GetPing` sub-function, which means it probably expects that as a field in its request. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bf781f9-44fe-4fef-919c-72c4987232c6)

We can deduce the fields for all 6 methods here in the same way. So we can start trying to make the auth server now, but how?

Since the `server` executable is in Go, we'll make the auth server in Go too. Go's implementation of the `rpc` protocol is `grpc`, and [this](https://pascalallen.medium.com/how-to-build-a-grpc-server-in-go-943f337c4e05) guide was helpful in getting started. Essentially, we first need to create a `.proto` file in which we define each of our functions, as well as their request and response parameters. That should be relatively easy to do based on what we found in Ghidra. The issue however is the `package` and `service` name that each `.proto` file needs. This is a little problematic because specifically the `service` needs to match on both the client and the server. 

Thankfully, using both Ghidra *and* Binja was pretty helpful here. If we go into the `auth/auth_grpc.(*authServiceClient).Ping` function we found in Ghidra on Binja, near the end we can see some interesting text that seems to refer to an error with a function call. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/795cf2ce-5327-4286-8b15-12c04c527f5d)

The text refers to `auth_service/AuthService`. `auth_service` is likely our package name, and `AuthService` is our `service` name. 

Now we have all we need, let's create our proto file. I name mine `ping.proto` since we're trying to get the ping function to work specifically, and set my `go_package` to `/seedGeneration`, since we saw some references to `seedGeneration` in those `main` functions we found earlier. The name of your proto file and `go_package` doesn't matter though.

```
syntax = "proto3";

package auth_service;

option go_package = "/seedGeneration";

service AuthService {
    rpc Authenticate(AuthenticateRequest) returns (AuthenticateResponse);
    rpc Logout(LogoutRequest) returns (LogoutResponse);
    rpc Ping(PingRequest) returns (PingResponse);
    rpc RefreshToken(RefreshTokenRequest) returns (RefreshTokenResponse);
    rpc RegisterOTPSeed(RegisterOTPSeedRequest) returns (RegisterOTPSeedResponse);
    rpc VerifyOTP(VerifyOTPRequest) returns (VerifyOTPResponse);
}

message AuthenticateRequest {
    // Define fields needed for authentication
    string username = 1; // User's username
    string password = 2; // User's password
}

message AuthenticateResponse {
    // Define fields for the response
    bool success = 1;        // Indicates if authentication was successful
    string message = 2;      // Optional message for additional information
}

message LogoutRequest {
    // Define fields needed for logout
}

message LogoutResponse {
    // Define fields for the response
}

message PingRequest {
    // Define fields needed for the request
    int64 ping = 1;
}

message PingResponse {
    int64 pong = 1;
}

message RefreshTokenRequest {
    // Define fields needed for refresh token
}

message RefreshTokenResponse {
    // Define fields for the response
}

message RegisterOTPSeedRequest {
    // Define fields needed for OTP seed registration
    string username = 1;
    int64 seed = 2;
}

message RegisterOTPSeedResponse {
    // Define fields for the response
    bool success = 1;
}

message VerifyOTPRequest {
    // Define fields needed for OTP verification
    string username = 1;
    int64 otp = 2;
}

message VerifyOTPResponse {
    // Define fields for the response
    bool success = 1;
    int64 token = 2;
}
```
</details>


With our `.proto` file made, we run the `protoc` command to compile it into some Go files for us to use

`protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. ping.proto`

Now let's create the auth server. In my code, I set up some sample checks for `AuthenticateRequest` and `VerifyOTP` just to see if they do anything. Most importantly, we run the server on port 50052.

```Go
package main

import (
	"context"

	"net"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
	"server/seedGeneration" // Replace with the actual import path for your generated pb

type server struct {

	return &seedGeneration.AuthenticateResponse{

	}
	return &seedGeneration.VerifyOTPResponse{

	// Listen on port 50052

Let's run it with `go run auth_server.go`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffccbf0f-df62-4354-b4cd-d150667b4034)

If we run the `server` executable again, we get a different result!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dfd2069-54d2-4402-a3a5-1a240d47830b)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc20ad7-64a8-4122-ac65-d35ad6880360)

So now the `server` executable is starting to act like an actual server, and is hosting something on port 50051. Now we essentially have to do what we just did for the auth server but backwards. Instead of finding and defining functions for a server to respond to, we need to instead find and define functions for a client so that we can call them. Thankfully however, we've already found them. They are the `main.(*seedGenerationServer)` functions we found from earlier.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17899698-21b4-4bff-ad0d-da479dc0cbe9)

We can find what parameters they expect from functions beginning with `otp/seedgen`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb5b4297-721a-4dff-a685-844ab86a5a78)

So for example, a `GetSeed` request expects a username and password

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e688fff-d8d7-4062-a2db-1b4225c27fa7)

What's our `package` and `service` names this time though? `package` I'll just call `seed_generation` due to the name of the `main` functions we found. We can find the `service` name in Ghidra, under `otp/seedgen`, there are a lot of functions defined with the name, `SeedGenerationService`. That's probably our `service` name.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a42ff05-4152-47c7-9096-7ac4cf995b91)

Now we can make our `.proto` file! I named mine `seedGeneration.proto`

<details>
	<Summary><i><ins>Click to expand seedGeneration.proto</ins></i></Summary>
	
```
syntax = "proto3";

package seed_generation; 

option go_package = "/seedGeneration";

service SeedGenerationService {
   
    rpc GetSeed(GetSeedRequest) returns (GetSeedResponse);
    rpc StressTest(GetStressTestRequest) returns (GetStressTestResponse);
    rpc Ping(GetPingRequest) returns (GetPingResponse);

}

message GetStressTestRequest {
    // Define fields needed for authentication
    int64 count = 1;
}

message GetStressTestResponse {
    // Define fields for the response
    string response = 1;

}

message GetSeedRequest {
    // Define fields needed for authentication
    string username = 1;
    string token = 2;
  
}

message GetSeedResponse {
    // Define fields for the response
    int64 seed = 1;
    int64 count = 2;
}

message GetPingRequest {
    // Define fields needed for the request
    int64 ping = 1;
}

message GetPingResponse {
    int64 pong = 1;
}
```
</details>

Instead of Go, it turns out you can do `grpc` stuff in Python too. To save myself the Go setup headache, I made my client in Python. For Python, compile the proto file with

`python -m grpc_tools.protoc --proto_path=. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. seedGeneration.proto`

(Make sure you have installed the needed Python libraries with `pip install grpcio grpcio-tools protobuf`)

I want to call the `GetSeed` function first since it seems the most promising. However as mentioned before, it expects a username and password. What could they be?

This is where the `shredded.jpg` image comes into play. I was thinking of what `JASPER` meant, or where I've seen it before, and then I remembered Task 1. On the suspicious order, one of the emails was `jasper_04044@guard.ar`!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2eda0be-aa33-4b92-9a18-b40467871f02)

`jasper_04044` is probably our username! For the password, I just went with `password` as a test. 

Let's make the client now in Python. I make some code to call `StressTest` too but I comment it out for now. I mainly want to see what `GetSeed` does. 

<details>
<Summary><i><ins>Click to expand client.py</ins></i></Summary>

```python
import grpc
import seedGeneration_pb2
import seedGeneration_pb2_grpc

def get_seed(stub, username, password):
    # Create the GetSeed request (add any fields if necessary)
    request = seedGeneration_pb2.GetSeedRequest(username=username, token=password)
    
    # Call the GetSeed method
    response = stub.GetSeed(request)
    
    return response

def stress_test(stub, count):
    request = seedGeneration_pb2.GetStressTestRequest(count=count)

    response = stub.StressTest(request)
    return response
    

def run():
    # Connect to the gRPC server
    with grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051') as channel:

        stub = seedGeneration_pb2_grpc.SeedGenerationServiceStub(channel)
        
        # Replace with your actual username and password
        
        username = "jasper_04044"
        password = "password"

        count = 1
        
        print("Send get_seed")
        response = get_seed(stub, username, password)
        print("Get seed response:")
        print(response)

        #response = stress_test(stub, count)
        #print(response)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```
</details>

If we run this, we get a response!

>Note the dates being after the competition is due to me recreating the results when making this writeup

Well, `{"time":"2025-02-15T20:57:05.742357055-06:00","level":"INFO","msg":"Registered OTP seed with authentication service","username":"jasper_04044","seed":8074660958352453125,"count":1}` is some JSON, and the 3 important keys are `{"username":"jasper_04044","seed":8074660958352453125,"count":1}`. Is this our answer? I submit this, but it says that what I have isn't quite right. So we have the correct keys, just not the correct values. What to do now?

After some thinking, I remembered that the prompt was asking for the output that would be given if the attackers had "successfully leveraged" the running software. That means that they had to exploit something. Looking back at the `GetSeed` function in Ghidra, we find something interesting. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdd1ab60-129f-41bd-960c-e8eaae5ea6f7)

A call to some sort of `auth` function. If we take a look, there's a lot of logic, but one if statement stands out. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ce8996f-0ff5-42a3-b933-6b596640e735)

It's even more evident in Binja with a `test user authenticated...` message

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21ef9c32-aa50-493c-a943-260c135b0f6c)

It seems that we have to somehow exploit the `server` executable, or its logic, in order to pass this conditional check. Well, how do we even go about doing that? First we need to see what's being passed into the `auth` function

Let's run `server` using gdb and set a breakpoint at `main.(*SeedgenAuthClient).auth`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dbcf66e-feca-474d-95de-7c908c88f33f)

If we run our client and call `GetSeed`, we hit our breakpoint 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7cd7a8d-c36a-4b21-b1a6-a9ca418b018f)

So username and password is passed into `auth`. Additionally, some kind of value, `c` is passed in as well to both `GetSeed` and `auth`. For our next step, let's see if we can rename some variables in the `auth` function on Ghidra to make it easier to read

Right off the bat, we can see that `uVar2` seems to be some kind of counter, since it starts at 0 and gets incremented by 4 each iteration. Let's rename it to `i`. 

Something interesting is `param_7`, which is set equal to `in_RAX`. If we run `client.py` and `server` again and hit the breakpoint in gdb, looking at what's stored in `rax`, we can see that this is what `c` is pointing to.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c2738f7-09ec-4141-a5a2-f3df4e2e804f)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/695c4c64-2a4d-4a41-bea6-f412acde7e4e)

We also see that `param_7[2]` is assigned to `lVar1`, which itself is assigned to a random number, `math/rand.Int63();`. Well in gdb we can see what that number is by using pointer arithmetic to essentially index `param_7[2]` through the memory address that `c` is pointing to. 

Re-running `client.py` and `server`, we hit the breakpoint again in gdb and this time get

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9f269a7-af86-41da-b791-a324591bf1fa)

Since `c` is pointing to `param_7`, let's use pointer arithmetic to get the value at `param_7[2]`. If we add `2*8` to this address, we should get the element at the index 2, since each element takes up 8 bytes. We get
 a value:

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/807b4eb7-42f3-4a0d-ba75-88fe285f6fa0)

 This is the number `6205117966191793308`

We get the response

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c65b1582-92e2-4146-a5e6-646e09ec4a7e)

That didn't really tell us much, let's do another run. 

This time we get

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17b381a2-7c74-4b3f-b8eb-97f6586ba64a)

This is the number `8074660958352453125`. Hey wait a second. That was our seed value from the last run!

This time we get this output:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/416900b3-c1d2-4a11-9f08-8a8f37434d61)

One more run to make sure we know what's going on.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b19f0c0-18ec-47e3-8a95-c5be2fcf9e58)

Sure enough, this is the number `3009302561299014827`, which was our seed from the last run. So we can confidently say that the random number generated is the seed, so we can rename `lVar1` to `seed` in Ghidra. We also keep in mind that `param_7[2]` is where the seed is stored. 

The logic seems to be indexing or taking chunks of `param_8` and assigning it to `uVar6`. `param_8` is assigned to `unaff_RBX`. If we look in gdb to see what's at `rbx`, we see that it's our username

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebdb1ca6-a3da-43d5-b23e-1e480c33bdd5)

So `param_8` is the username, and we can change the name accordingly. We'll rename `uVar6` to `chunk`, since it's essentially a chunk of the username. 

If we look at the what dictates the loop, the loop is dependent on `i` being less than `param_9`. Well if we're taking chunks of the username each time, `param_9` is likely the length of the username, since it would stop the loop if `i` is greater than or equal to the username's length. We can change `param_9` accordingly. 

The function then XOR's the username chunk and whatever `uVar4` is. `uVar4` is checked with the value `0x7032f1e8` in each iteration to see if they are equal, and then prints the `user authenticated...` message we saw before in Binja. We'll rename `uVar4` to `target`. 

After our variable renaming, we now have this code.

</details>

Let's look at what it's doing. It gets a little confusing since the function initially has the `seed` variable as the randomly generated seed, assigns it to `param_7[2]`, and then reuses it later as `seed = username_length - i;`. Regardless, we can get a good grasp of what's going on. 

`target` starts as the randomly generated `seed` value. 

`target = param_7[2];`

`auth` then takes the username, and loops through it 4 bytes (characters) at a time. 

```c
 i = 0;
  do {
    if ((long)username_length <= (long)i) {
    ... Logic ...
    }
    i = i + 4;
  } while( true );
```

In each iteration, it XOR's `target` with the 4 byte chunk. 

`target = (ulong)((uint)target ^ chunk);`

After it finishes looping through the username and doing all the XOR logic, it checks to see if the final result equals `0x7032f1e8`. 

```c
if ((uint)target == 0x7032f1e8) {
	log/slog.(*Logger).log(dVar3);
	return param_7[2];
}
```
So our goal is to find the username, seed, and count that once going through the XOR logic, will equal `0x7032f1e8`. Based on the `shredded.jpg` image, it seems that we already have the correct username, which is `jasper_04044`. We just need to find the seed and count. 

Technically, we could just call `GetSeed` a bunch of times, but that would take forever. The simplest way would be to recreate all this logic and run it locally. There's just one issue, which is the randomly generated number. I thought it would change each time, which would make it impossible to do locally, but after resetting the `server` executable, we can see that the seed values at the corresponding counts are the same each time

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c21daea-de18-4a52-98bc-62015718c8fe)

Or in other words, count 1 is always the seed `8074660958352453125`, count 2 is always the seed `3009302561299014827`, etc, etc every time. This is why count is one of the important keys in the JSON we have to submit, since it is tied to the correct seed. The fact that the same seeds are generated each time means that the random number generator is seeded, we just have to find what the rng seed is (sorry for saying seed so much there). 

In Ghidra, we can find the function, `math/rand.(*Rand).Seed`, which is the Go function used to seed its random number generator. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0aba82b-ab3a-4409-adf3-d604de833792)

Back in gdb, let's set a breakpoint there.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07170d5f-6c9f-447a-9eac-151af8c6b3bc)

If we run this, we immediately hit the breakpoint, and we can get our seed value!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b0b4992-1cbe-4a31-b500-fe06f35a58e0)

It's `0x378f96687bfa0`

We have everything we need, let's start making our solve. We will continuously generate numbers using the seeded random number generator, take it and the username `jasper_04044`, go through the XOR logic and loop that we discussed earlier, and check to see if the final result equals `0x7032f1e8`. We'll code the solve in Go since the `server` executable uses specifically Go's random number generator.

I print the first few attempts to see if the seed aligns with the count. We initialize `attempts` to -1 to align the counts and seeds the same way that the `server` executable does. 

Running this with `go run solve.go`, it takes a while, but eventually finishes. We get the output:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/195f5e0e-5cc1-4d78-8c00-1b54eb51a8be)

Is this our answer?? I submit `{"username":"jasper_04044","seed":"7571067976073007827","count":"1073639578"}` but it still says it's incorrect. What the heck are we doing wrong, we have the answer right here!

After a long time I realized a fatal mistake I was making. 

Remember when we were using gdb to find out what was stored in `param_7[2]`, and found out that it was the seed? Remember the first number we saw was `6205117966191793308`? After some testing, I find that `6205117966191793308` is actually the *first* seed to be generated by the random number generator, not `8074660958352453125`. `8074660958352453125` is actually the *second* generated number. `6205117966191793308` technically should be the seed that gets printed with count 1. But instead, the *next* seed, `8074660958352453125` is what got printed. 

What does this mean for us? Even though `7571067976073007827` is the correct seed that along with the username would pass the XOR logic, what would get printed to the screen? The *next* seed. The prompt didn't ask for the correct seed, username, and count combo to pass the XOR logic, it asked for the correct seed, username, and count combo that would be ***logged*** once successfully leveraged. 

I tweak the code to print the next seed after we pass the Xor logic
